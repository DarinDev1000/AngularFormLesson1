# AngularFormLesson1

I designed this project to teach during an Angular bootcamp at ValleyWorx (Summer 2019).

I have also used it in a tutorial for hosting a frontend website on AWS. [Hosting a SPA (Angular/React/Vue) or static website with Amazon Web Services](https://medium.com/@darindev1000/hosting-angular-or-a-static-website-with-amazon-web-services-625d564b3464?source=friends_link&sk=b4864a042d6af15e13ed3f58c7d612e1)

It is now being hosted on AWS S3 with CloudFront and Route 53 at https://form-lesson.darindev1000.com

# How to use

* Open your web browser to http://localhost:4200/

---------------------------------------------------

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
